# Asynchronous cache

Your colleague wants to improve the performance of a web application by caching
common results in an in-memory LRU cache, where the least recently used results
are evicted when the cache is full, and wants your opinion on the best way to
implement it.

He has already implemented the `Cache` interface, which he will use to
store the cached results. The `Cache` interface is defined as follows:

```java
interface Cache<K, V> {
    /**
     * Returns the value associated with the given key, or null if the key is not
     * present in the cache.
     */
    CompletableFuture<V> get(K key);

    /**
     * Associates the given value with the given key in the cache. If the cache
     * already contains a value for the given key, it is replaced.
     */
    CompletableFuture<Void> put(K key, V value);
}
```

What do you think of this interface?
