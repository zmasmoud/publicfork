# Evaluation Criteria

- Understanding the difference between concurrent and parallel execution

# Proposed Solution

The wrong suggestion is that the operation will run faster.
Executing code concurrently does not mean necessarily in parallel, concurrency creates the illusion of parallelism even
if it's running on a single CPU. If it's indeed running on a single CPU core, the operation will actually take even more
time because of the additional time of each context switch between the operation thread and UI thread. If it's running
on multiple CPUs, it will take the same time, since the operation itself is the same (it hasn't been divided between
multiple threads), the only difference is that it's running in parallel with the UI thread. In both cases, the app will
become more fluid (without freezes), since the user will not have to wait until the operation finishes to continue
interacting with the app.
