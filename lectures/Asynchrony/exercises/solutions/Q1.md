# Evaluation Criteria

- Noticing that only the second code snippet runs asynchronously

# Proposed Solution

The first obvious thing that comes to mind, is that the first code uses callbacks while the second uses futures. While
this is true, the most important thing is that the first code runs sequentially while the second asynchronously. Using
callbacks or futures does not necessarily mean that the code runs asynchronously.
