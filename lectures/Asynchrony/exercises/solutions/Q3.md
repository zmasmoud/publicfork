# Evaluation Criteria

- The answer mentions that the cache interface should be synchronous.

# Proposed Solution

Your colleague's `Cache` interface is asynchronous, which isn't
necessary for a cache that will store values in memory. This may even make the
interface more difficult to use, as the caller will have to wait for the result
of the `CompletableFuture`s when it could just use the value directly in a
synchronous manner.

The risk of exposing asynchronous APIs is that the caller will likely need to
expose asynchronous APIs as well, which can make the code more complex.
