Your team's project manager decides that the team should stop working on new features for the next two weeks
and instead focus on improving the performance and stability of the product to provide a better user experience.
Your colleague thinks that he has an idea that might drastically improve the performance of the app, which is optimizing
the function that handles sanitizing and validating user input. He says that it will probably take him a couple of days
to implement it, so he suggests that he should jump right into it. What do you think of your colleague's approach?
