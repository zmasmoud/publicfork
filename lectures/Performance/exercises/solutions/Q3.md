# Evaluation Criteria

- It should point the issue of optimizing before profiling
- It should explain why it's problematic and what benefits profiling first brings

# Proposed Solution

The colleague should start off by profiling first. He might have an idea to improve the performance
of a component of the app, but it might not be the performance bottleneck. Thus, the end user won't
notice any improvement.
