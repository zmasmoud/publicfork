# Evaluation Criteria

- You should indicate the benefits and drawbacks of using Bachmann-Landau
  ("big O") notation to characterize the performance of a program.

# Proposed Solution

While Bachmann-Landau notation offers a formal description of how the runtime
of an algorithm grows with respect to the size of its input, it's sometimes not
enough to understand the performance of an algorithm. Typically, high constant
factors may make an algorithm that is theoretically faster than another one
slower in practice. This can be determined by running benchmarks with various
input sizes.

For example, many sorting algorithms tend to use insertion sort, which has a
worst-case complexity of `O(n^2)`, for small inputs (up to ~20 elements).
This is because the overhead of using a more complex algorithm is not worth it
for small inputs.
Similarly, [some sorting algorithms combine quicksort and heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort)
in the same way, using quicksort for small inputs and heapsort if quicksort
reaches a certain recursion depth.

Your colleague should therefore run benchmarks with various input sizes to
determine which algorithm fits their use case best (and possibly use an
implementation that is part of the standard library, which will account for
language- and platform-specific optimizations).
