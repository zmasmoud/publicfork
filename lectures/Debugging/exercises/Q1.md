You decide to contribute to an open source project, by adding a feature to an existing class of the project.
The class uses an underscore at the beginning of names then "camelCase" for private properties such as `_likeThis`,
but you find this odd because you're used to the "snake case" `like_this`.
Which option would you choose for the name of the new private property that you will add?
What could the team in charge of the project do to simplify this choice?
