# Evaluation Criteria

- Accept that the existing naming convention in a project has priority over the convention that you personally prefer

- Find out about the existence of tools to automatically verify that a convention has been used

# Proposed Solution

Whatever your personal convictions, you have to adapt to the convention used by the project.
(Eventually, if you become a major contributor to the project, you can then participate in discussions to decide on
these conventions;
and in rare cases, it is possible that a convention is a source of bugs and that we can discuss it in terms other than
preferences)

The project team could avoid this problem entirely by forcing any contribution to use the existing convention,
which can be done automatically using lint / static analysis tools.
