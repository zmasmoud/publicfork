# Proposed solution

By running the program, you should identify that the sorting algorithm crashes, since bounds are
not properly checked. Using the debugger, you should be able to identify that the bounds of the
`sort` method are not correct. Indeed, the precondition is that the sorted array starts at index
`from` and ends at index `until - 1`. However, this is not checked in the base case.

After fixing the bug, you should be able to run the program and see that the sorting algorithm
throws a `StackOverflowError`. This is because the algorithm is recursive, but does not hit a
base case. Here, the pivot is not correctly chosen, and the algorithm will recurse on the same
subarray.

Finally, the `partition` method does not move the pivot to the correct position. Indeed, there is
an off-by-one error after the loop that moves the pivot to the right position. Inspecting the memory
at this stage of the execution should help you identify the bug.

Here are some corrected implementations of the `sort` and `partition` methods:

```java
public class Quicksort {

  private static <T> void sort(T[] elements, Comparator<T> comparator, int from, int until) {
    if (from == until) {                                      // BUG 1 : Wrong termination condition
      return;
    }
    var pivot = partition(elements, comparator, from, until);
    sort(elements, comparator, from, pivot);
    sort(elements, comparator, pivot + 1, until);             // BUG 2 : Missing the `+ 1` here
  }

  private static <T> int partition(T[] elements, Comparator<T> comparator, int from, int until) {
    var pivot = elements[from];
    var split = until;
    for (var i = until - 1; i > from; i--) {
      if (comparator.compare(elements[i], pivot) > 0) {
        split--;
        swap(elements, i, split);
      }
    }
    swap(elements, from, split - 1);                          // BUG 3 : Wrong offset
    return split - 1;
  }

  // Omitted for brevity
}
```
