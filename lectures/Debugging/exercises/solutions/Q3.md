# Evaluation Criteria

- The solution must make it possible to catch the problems as soon as possible, without requiring an unreasonable
  effort.

- The "all or nothing" qualification must be correct and justified (a correct qualification without justification is not
  useful)

# Proposed Solution

The code can be modified to add pre-conditions and post-conditions, instead of silently calculating meaningless values.
For example, code that needs a sorted array can check that the array is sorted.
This solution can be applied proportionally, it is not "all or nothing". For example, the X module can check that the
calculated coefficient is not negative, which is very fast, even if it does not check that the array is sorted, which
can take time depending on the size of the array.
