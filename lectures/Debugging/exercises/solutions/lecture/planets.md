- The indentation is inconsistent (2, 3, 7 spaces...)
- The names of classes are inconsistent (camelCase, snake_case, Firstletteruppercased, ...)
- There is commented-out code that could be removed
- The comments are useless as they try to describe _how_ the code works...
  - ...and misleading, because `sorted` _returns_ a sorted list, it does not sort in-place
