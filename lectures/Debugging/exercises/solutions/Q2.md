# Evaluation Criteria

- The given pre-conditions must exactly delimit valid inputs from others: the array must not be null or empty and the
  percentage must be between 0 and 100 (inclusive)

- The compromise on the post-condition must be reasonable, and its advantages and disadvantages clearly explained (it is
  not useful to propose a compromise without explanation)

# Proposed Solution

Pre-conditions:

- `0 <= n`
- `n <= 100`
- `values != null`
- `values.length != 0`

The post-condition can be written to only run during "debug" builds, such as automated tests.
The advantage is not to penalize "release" builds from a performance point of view, the disadvantage is that "release"
bugs will be more difficult to debug.
