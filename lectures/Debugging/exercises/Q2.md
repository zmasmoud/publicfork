You are writing an implementation for the following function:

```
/** Find the N-th percentile of the array of values provided, e.g., 50% = median, 100% = maximum */
int findPercentile(int[] values, int n)
```

Which pre-conditions should this method have?
To facilitate debugging, you decided to add a post-condition: the returned value must be in the array `values`.
However, one of your colleagues notices that the post-condition requires to iterate the whole array, and does not agree
because this function will be used frequently in a code whose latency must be minimized. What compromise would you
suggest? What are its pros and cons?
