# Backward Compatibility

Your team is discussing the following code:

```java
public final class DataStructure {
    public void add(int val) { /*...*/ }

    private boolean isFull() { /*...*/ }
}
```

1) One of your colleagues suggests that `add` should be changed to return a boolean indicating whether the passed value
   was added or not. Explain whether this breaks backward compatibility and why or why not (without worrying about
   whether this is a good or a bad thing).

2) Another colleague thinks that `isFull` should be made public. Explain whether this breaks backward compatibility
   and why or why not (also without worrying about whether this is a good or a bad thing)

3) They were thinking as well of changing the parameter type of `add` to an `Integer`. Explain whether this breaks
   backward compatibility and why or why not (also without worrying about whether this is a good or a bad thing).
