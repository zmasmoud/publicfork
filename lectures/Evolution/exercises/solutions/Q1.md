# Evaluation Criteria

- Stating whether the changes break backward compatibility, with a concise and accurate explanation

# Proposed Solution

1) Changing the signature of a public method will break binary compatibility, as existing compiled code refers to
   the method using a `void`-returning signature. While the change is backward source compatible, it is not overall backward compatible.

2) Changing the signature of a private method does not break compatibility, since nobody else could call it.

3) Changing the parameter type from `int` to its wrapper class `Integer` will break backward binary compatibility for the
   reasons explained previously, but it remains source compatible thanks to Java's autoboxing capability.
