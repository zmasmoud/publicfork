# Evaluation Criteria

- Using the appropriate release type with a reasonable explanation

# Proposed Solution

1) Including a major bugfix in a minor release instead of a bugfix release will cause an incoherent changelog and an
   inconvenience for users who wish to only apply the patch without any other changes. The bugfix could be as well an
   urgent security fix and should not wait to the next minor release date.
2) Removing a method could be done in a minor release if it's backward compatible, otherwise it must be done into a
   major release. In the case of an incompatible change, it is wise to start by annotating the method as
   deprecated in the upcoming release before removing it in a later one.
3) The benefit of depending on the latest available minor version means that we will always be up-to-date with the latest
   bugfixes and security/performance improvements as well. But the problem with this approach is that it
   could lead to unexpected behaviour which could cause bugs, because two compatible versions can still
   have slightly different behaviour.
