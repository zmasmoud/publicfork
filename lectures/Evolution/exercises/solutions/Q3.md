# Evaluation Criteria

- Mentioning that you should deprecate the old methods before removing them.
- Suggesting maintaining the old methods for a while, since they require
  very little maintenance, and removing them later.

# Proposed Solution

Since the library is already used, it's important to be careful when
changing the API. A good way to do this is to deprecate the old methods
before removing them, to give users time to migrate to the new methods.

Additionally, the old methods can easily be re-implemented as eager wrappers
around the new methods. Therefore, it's a good idea to keep both of them
around for a while, and only remove the old methods later if there's a good
reason for which eager evaluation shouldn't be exposed by the library.
