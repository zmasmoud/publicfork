# Legacy code

You are working on a legacy codebase for a publicly released library that has
been around for a while, and are tasked to modernize it. In particular, your team
has noticed that a lot of functions return `java.util.Collection` objects, which
eagerly compute their contents, and wants to replace them with lazily computed
`java.util.stream.Stream` sequences. One of your colleagues suggests updating
the library to replace all the `java.util.Collection` return types, and publish
a new major version of the library. What are you thoughts on this?
