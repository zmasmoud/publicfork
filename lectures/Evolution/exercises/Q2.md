# Code releases

1) Your colleague wants to wait until the next minor release to include a major bugfix instead of making a bugfix
   release. Explain why this is not a good idea.

2) In the process of reworking the architecture of the project, you need to remove a method because it's too easy to use
   incorrectly and there's now an easier-to-use replacement. What changes should you make for upcoming releases?

3) Your project depends on the latest available minor release version of a package instead of a hardcoded exact version,
   what are the pros and cons of this?
