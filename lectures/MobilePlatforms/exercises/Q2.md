# Question 2: Intents

All Android activities are started or activated with an intent. Intents are message objects that make a request to
the Android runtime to start an activity or other app component in your app **or in some other app**. You don't start
those activities yourself. When your app is first started from the device home screen, the Android runtime sends an
intent to your app to start your app's main activity. In addition to starting activities, intents are also used to
pass data between activities. When you create an intent to start a new activity, you can include information about
the data you want that new activity to operate on. So, for example, an email activity that displays the list of
emails in the inbox can send an intent when a user clicks on an email to the activity that displays the content of an
email. The display activity needs data about the email inorder to display it, and you can include that data in the
intent.
