# Question 1: Activities

An activity represents a single screen in your app with a UI that the user can interact with. For example, an email
app might have one activity that shows a list of emails in the inbox, another activity to write a new email, and
another activity for displaying the content of an email.

An activity's lifecycle is the set of states an activity can be in during its entire lifetime, from the time it is
initially created to when it is destroyed. As the user interacts with your app, the different activities move into
different states. When an activity transitions into and out of the different lifecycle states as it runs, the Android
system calls several lifecycle callback methods at each stage. All the callback methods can be overridden in each of
your Activity classes to define how that activity behaves when the user leaves and re-enters the activity.

**Your friend is developing an email app, he is currently working on a new feature. When the users quit the app while
writing an email, the new feature is going to save it as a draft instead of being lost. Can you help him by
explaining how you would implement it?**
