# Evaluation Criteria

- Shows a good understanding on what is a Service and how to use it properly.

# Proposed Solution

Running a blocking operation in an activity, such as a network operation, can lead to a bad user experience, because
of lack of reactivity of the app in case of a slow network. He should use a service to fetch the required data, and
he must create a new thread within the service to do that work. By using a separate thread, the application's main
thread can remain dedicated to user interaction with your activities.
