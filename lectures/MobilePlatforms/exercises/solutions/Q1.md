# Evaluation Criteria

- Shows a good understanding on what is Android Activity and its lifecycles

# Proposed Solution

He should override the `onDestroy()` callback and persist the data in it, which is called when the activity is
finishing (user dismissing the activity) or being destroyed by the system. Then he should also override
the `onResume()` callback to retrieve the persisted data and to display it as a previous draft. He should also note
that in case of a sudden shutdown, because of resource constraints or not enough battery, the `onDestroy()` method will
not be called. Therefore, if it's very important he should save data as soon as the user enters it.
