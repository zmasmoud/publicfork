You want to create an application that allows users to manage their e-books. These books will be stored in a local
database, with attributes like name, file, etc. In addition, your application will allow to add notes on books, which
will be stored separately in the database, and to send a book with its notes by e-mail to friends, who can import
the book and the notes in the app.

What modules would you define? How will they be put together to form an application in a clean way?
