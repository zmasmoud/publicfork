# Evaluation criteria

- The `BankAccount` class should not be responsible for converting between currencies.
- The existing `BankAccount` API should remain unchanged.

# Proposed Solution

There are multiple problems with the code, which include:

- the `CurrencyType` does not logically belong to `BankAccount`, and should thus be moved to the top
  level;
- the code to convert between currencies is duplicated in the `add` and `remove` methods;
- the code to convert currencies has duplication within itself, since e.g. converting euros to
  dollars can be computed from the conversion of dollars to euros;

The first step when refactoring code could for instance be to move the `CurrencyType` enum to the
top level, and extract the conversion logic to the top level as well. This would allow us to write
object-oriented code that is more readable and maintainable.

```java
enum CurrencyType {
  DOLLAR(1.0), EURO(1.15), POUND(1.31);

  private final double toDollar;

  CurrencyType(double toDollar) {
    this.toDollar = toDollar;
  }

  public double convert(double amount, CurrencyType into) {
    return (amount * toDollar) / into.toDollar;
  }
}
```

This will drastically reduce the amount of code in the `BankAccount` class, and make it easier to
understand.

```java
class BankAccount {

  public BankAccount(CurrencyType currencyType, double amount) {
    this.currencyType = currencyType;
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  private final CurrencyType currencyType;
  private double amount;

  public void add(CurrencyType addedType, double addedAmount) {
    if (addedAmount < 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Amount must be positive.");
    }
    amount += addedType.convert(addedAmount, currencyType);
  }

  public boolean remove(CurrencyType removedType, double removedAmount) {
    double inCurrency = removedType.convert(removedAmount, currencyType);
    if (inCurrency > amount) {
      return false;
    }
    amount -= inCurrency;
    return true;
  }

  public CurrencyType getCurrencyType() {
    return currencyType;
  }

  public double getAmount() {
    return amount;
  }
}
```

However, this code is still not ideal. In the real world, currency exchange rates are not constant,
and thus the conversion logic should be moved to a separate class. This will allow us to easily
change the conversion logic in the future, and also better separate concerns.

```java
interface CurrencyConverter {
  double convert(double amount, CurrencyType from, CurrencyType into);
}
```

We may for instance implement this interface as follows:

```java
class FixedCurrencyService implements CurrencyService {
  private static double getMultiplier(CurrencyType from, CurrencyType to) {
    if (from == to) {
      return 1;
    }
    if (from == CurrencyType.DOLLAR && to == CurrencyType.EURO) {
      return 0.87;
    }
    if (from == CurrencyType.DOLLAR && to == CurrencyType.POUND) {
      return 0.76;
    }
    if (from == CurrencyType.POUND && to == CurrencyType.EURO) {
      return 1.14;
    }
    return 1 / getMultiplier(to, from);
  }

  public double convert(double amount, CurrencyType from, CurrencyType to) {
    return getMultiplier(from, to) * amount;
  }
}
```

Finally, we can inject the `CurrencyConverter` into the `BankAccount` class:

```java
class BankAccount {

  public BankAccount(CurrencyType currencyType, double amount, CurrencyService currencyService) {
    this.currencyType = currencyType;
    this.amount = amount;
    this.currencyService = currencyService;
  }

  private CurrencyType currencyType;
  private double amount;
  private CurrencyService currencyService;

  public void add(CurrencyType addedType, double addedAmount) {
    if (addedAmount < 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Added amount cannot be negative.");
    }

    amount += currencyService.convert(addedAmount, addedType, currencyType);
  }

  public boolean remove(CurrencyType removedType, double removedAmount) {
    if (removedAmount < 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Removed amount cannot be negative.");
    }

    double amountToRemove = currencyService.convert(removedAmount, removedType, currencyType);
    if (amountToRemove > amount) {
      return false;
    }
    amount -= amountToRemove;
    return true;
  }

  public CurrencyType getCurrencyType() {
    return currencyType;
  }

  public double getAmount() {
    return amount;
  }
}
```
