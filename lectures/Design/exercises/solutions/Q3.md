# Evaluation Criteria

- The proposed modules each offer a clear abstraction

- The system is composed of modules grouped in layers by level of abstraction and without unnecessary or circular
  dependencies

# Proposed Solution

The lowest level modules are the generic database, and sending e-mails. The books module and the notes module use the
database, and the sharing function uses e-mail. Then, we can for example have a ViewModel using these three intermediate
modules, and a user interface on top of it:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Interface]
    B[ViewModel]
    C[Notes]
    D[Books]
    E[Sharing]
    F[Email]
    G[Database]
    A --> B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    B --> E
    C --> G
    E --> F
    D --> G
```
