# Proposed Solution

- The fact that `Cloneable` does not contain the `clone` method is strange! This means that if we
  have a variable of type `Cloneable`, we cannot clone it, since the `clone` method on `Object` is
  `protected` and therefore each class that wants to provide a public method to clone must do so
  explicitly, without an interface that generalizes the concept.
- The biggest issue is that `Stack` inherits from `Vector`, which means anyone can use `Vector`
  methods such as `elementAt` (to get an item not at the top of the stack)
  or `add(int index, E element)` (to add an item not at the top of the stack). This class should
  instead _contain_ a `Vector` as an implementation detail.
  Additionally, the indexing system of `search` is completely inconsistent with every other Java
  collection, which uses 0-based indexing. While it is not an incorrect abstraction on its own, it
  is clearly wrong in context. This method should use 0-based indexing.
