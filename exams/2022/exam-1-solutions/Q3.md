# Question 3: Good code practice and debugging [15 points]
You are working on a school project with your friend, and you receive this code snippet:

```scala
// Note: leave the prints as I am still testing this code !!!!

object Main {
    val interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser = new CommandInterpreter

    // Use the correct function when needed
    private def handleArguments(stringOfArgumenGivenByUser: String): Int = {
        // splits the parameter with a ',' and turns it into a list
        val theArrayFromTheArgumentThatWeSplit = stringOfArgumenGivenByUser.split(" ").toList
        theArrayFromTheArgumentThatWeSplit match
            case "--execute" :: xs =>
                println(s"Argument of execute: $xs")
                // give the arguments of execute to the interpreter so that it can execute
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.execute(xs)
            case "--fetch" :: xs =>
                println(s"Argument of fetch: $xs")
                // give the arguments of fetch to the interpreter so that it can fetch what's needed
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.fetch(xs)
            // This method is not yet functional in CommandInterpreter yet
            // Please live it commented for later uses
            /*
            case "--export" :: filename :: _ =>
                // give the filename of where to export to the interpreter so that it can export at the correct location
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.export(filename)
            */
            case _ =>
                println("Command not found.")
                // in other cases, ask the interpreter to show help
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.showHelp()
    }


    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        // loop on the arguments to handle everything
        for {
            argumentFromTheArray <- args
        } do {
            handleArguments(argumentFromTheArray)
        }

    }
}
```

Your friend uses `print` to debug his code. Is this a good idea and, regardless of whether it is bad or not,
is there a better way to do it? Explain why or why not in max 2 sentences. [3 points]
> No, it's not, you have to potentially write a lot of statements that you'll need to manually remove. 
> Using a debugger, your friend could add breakpoints that prints the values, and can change them on the fly.

Your friend claims that the names are good because they describe exactly what is going on. Do you agree? 
Explain in max 2 sentences. [4 points]
> The names are too detailed, which makes the code hard to read.

In order to make the code easier to understand, your friend added comments. Are they correctly used? Explain in max 2
sentences. [4 points]
> They are not use correctly. Comments are made to explain why a piece of code does what it does and not how it does it.

Your friend insists that the commented-out case not be touched for now, because the class `CommandInterpreter` will soon
be updated. Think of what your friend is trying to accomplish, and suggest an alternate way to achieve the same
objective in max 2 sentences. [4 points]
> Using a VCS, my friend would be able to go back to an earlier version of the code to retrieve that case once `CommandInterpreter` has been updated.
