# Question 1: From feedback to story [8 points]
Congratulations on your new position at JaaS, the Jokes-as-a-Service platform. With JaaS, everyone can be funny any time
by having new jokes at their fingertips via a public API.

Your first task is to convert user feedback into user stories. Here is one such piece of feedback:

```text
Hi, I have been using your app for a long time, but I've been recently diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, which
made me blind in both eyes, so I canâ€™t read anymore. I've been trying to use the Voice-Over feature on my phone, since
it is supposed to be able to read out loud what the app displays. However, it seems to only be able to read the title of
the jokes, not the actual jokes themselves. I have not made anyone laugh in 3 months, and I feel miserable! A friend of
mine told me that it could be because your app displays the jokes as images instead of text, which is not supported by
the voice-over program on my phone. Please do something!
```

Turn this feedback into a user story that follows the guidelines taught in class:
> As a visually impaired user, I want my reading assistant to be able to read the jokes out loud, so that I can make my friends laugh.

_A user story that summarizes all necessary information from the feedback earns 4 points. If, in addition to this, the
user story does not contain any unnecessary information, it will earn 4 more points._
