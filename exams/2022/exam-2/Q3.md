# Question 3: Performance [15 points]

Some of your colleagues work on an AI-based image generation service, where a user enters a topic,
and the AI generates a synthetic photo on that topic. They tell you the following about this service:

```
Currently, the user types in the topic they want to see images for,
and the client app sends a request to the server with the user ID and the indicated topic.
The server generates an image, which takes a second or so, and sends it to the client app,
which then requests another image on the same topic, and so on, until the app has received 9 images. It then displays these in a 3x3 grid.
The user now looks at the 9 images and, if they see an inappropriate one, they click on a button that causes the app to send a review request to the server.
Human moderators then process each report, and data scientists tweak the AI model to avoid generating images similar to the ones reported as inappropriate.
Users then get a notification that their report was processed. The whole reporting process typically takes a day.
```

Explain in 1-2 sentences what you could do on the server side, without any changes to the client app, so that users get their images faster:

> ??? 

Now assume you can change the server's interface. Explain in 1-2 sentences an alternative way to make the app display the 9 images faster:

> ???

One colleague remarks that the "report an image for moderation" feature currently starts by spending 10 seconds in the background on the client side,
and they have a way to speed this step up by 90%.
In comparison, the optimizations you have devised for image generation would save around 30% of the current 10 seconds it takes for an entire image grid.
Explain in 1-2 sentences whether the team should prioritize optimizing the "report an image for moderation" function over image generation:

> ???
