# Question 2: API problems [14 points]

Your team is developing a library that is mostly intended to be used by your company's own applications,
but the library is nevertheless distributed via a public repo on GitHub. It contains the following function:
```java
public InputStream convertToPdf(Document document) throws GoogleServerNotRespondingError
```
A security consultant points out that passing an arbitrary document can lead to security issues
since the document could link to malicious content from the Internet,
and your own application does not actually use this flexibility as it only prints plain text.
The consultant suggests replacing the `Document` parameter by a `String`.

You agree, but identify some risk associated with this. Explain in one sentence the main problem that such a parameter change could lead to:

> It breaks backward compatibility, because the signature changes and `Document` is not a special kind of `String` thus callers will have to be updated

This API also has a maintainability problem. Explain in 1-2 sentences what it is:

> This is an abstraction leak: the error should not be Google-specific, as users of the functions should not know or care we internally use Google.

Describe in 1-2 sentences how to fix this problem:

> Catch the Google error internally and throw a more general one.
> Alternatively, change the thrown exception type to a superclass of `GoogleServerNotRespondingError` that is not Google-specific, if it has one.
