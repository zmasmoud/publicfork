# EPFL Software Engineering

This course teaches the basics of software engineering,
enabling students to go from _writing code_ to _developing software_.

This repository contains all course material.

The course is originally taught by the [Dependable Systems Lab](https://dslab.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](https://ic.epfl.ch).
For EPFL-specific details please see [the course web page](https://dslab.epfl.ch/teaching/sweng/).


## Course objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:
- Recognize common needs and issues in software development
- Explain why specific techniques help and why simpler techniques are inadequate
- Implement correct, efficient, and reliable software at the level of functions, modules, and programs
- Organize the development of software during its entire lifecycle, from team formation to long-term support
- Critique software developed by others in a constructive and evidence-based manner
- Produce software that enables users to reliably and efficiently perform the tasks they require


## Lectures

This course introduces key software engineering topics in one lecture each.
Each lecture is designed to take 120 minutes and includes exercises to be done during the lecture,
longer exercises to be done after the lecture, and a small quiz to refresh one's memory before going on to the next lecture.

The first three lectures should be done in order, as they are prerequisites for the rest:

1. [Introduction](lectures/Introduction/) and [Requirements](lectures/Requirements/)
2. [Infrastructure](lectures/Infrastructure/)
3. [Testing](lectures/Testing/)

The remaining lectures can be done in any order, here is a suggested one:

- [Debugging](lectures/Debugging/)
- [Design](lectures/Design/)
- [Performance](lectures/Performance/)
- [Evolution](lectures/Evolution/)
- [Asynchrony](lectures/Asynchrony/)
- [Teamwork](lectures/Teamwork/)
- [Security](lectures/Security/)


## Exams

For example purposes, we provide [past exams](exams/).


## Project

We additionally provide the basics for a [project-based course](project/) for students to apply what they have learned in this course,
by building an Android app in teams using a Scrum-like method.


## Teaching philosophy

This course uses modern evidence-based teaching methods, with a particular focus on interactivity during lectures through exercises and
clear structuring of lectures including well-defined objectives and assessment criteria.
There is a large body of research on teaching and learning, and this course attempts to use evidence-based techniques to improve
learning compared to the traditional "sit in a lecture hall and listen for a couple hours" format.

Students should read the [guide to succeed](documentation/Succeeding.md).

Lecturers should read the [logistics documentation](documentation/Logistics.md).


## Contributing

Want to help?

You can:
- Propose improvements to the existing lectures, such as correcting typos and ambiguities, finding interesting examples, or proposing different explanations
- Propose improvements to the existing exercises, such as correcting typos and ambiguities, or proposing alternative solutions
- Translate some exercises to a different programming language, especially if that language exhibits interesting differences
  compared to the existing languages for the exercises
- Propose an entirely new lecture, see [the lectures documentation](documentation/Lectures.md)
