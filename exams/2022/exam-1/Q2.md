# Question 2: Development Workflow [15 points]

During the orientation at JaaS, the VP of engineering explains to you their workflow:

1. Branching: Developers must use a separate branch for each feature, and they must commit their code once a day.
2. Testing: When their feature is finished, developers must run a test suite locally, on their machine, and make sure
   that every test passes. Once that's done, they can commit and push, then open a PR describing the feature, with a
   screenshot of the test results attached, and wait for code reviews from colleagues.
3. Merging: If no one requested changes on the code within 24 hours, one can merge the PR to the main branch.

Each of the three directives above contains a flaw. Give a better alternative for each step, and explain why your
alternative is better in maximum 2 sentences below:

1. Branching [4 points]

> ???

2. Testing [7 points]

> ???

3. Merging [4 points]

> ???

_For each of the three directives, an answer that points out the correct flaw earns 1 point. An answer that gives a
better alternative earns another 1 point. In addition to this, an answer that also gives a good explanation earns the
rest of the indicated points for that particular directive._
