# Question 3: Good code practice and debugging [15 points]

You are working on a school project with your friend, and you receive this code snippet:

```scala
// Note: leave the prints as I am still testing this code !!!!

object Main {
    val interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser = new CommandInterpreter

    // Use the correct function when needed
    private def handleArguments(stringOfArgumenGivenByUser: String): Int = {
        // splits the parameter with a ',' and turns it into a list
        val theArrayFromTheArgumentThatWeSplit = stringOfArgumenGivenByUser.split(" ").toList
        theArrayFromTheArgumentThatWeSplit match
            case "--execute" :: xs =>
                println(s"Argument of execute: $xs")
                // give the arguments of execute to the interpreter so that it can execute
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.execute(xs)
            case "--fetch" :: xs =>
                println(s"Argument of fetch: $xs")
                // give the arguments of fetch to the interpreter so that it can fetch what's needed
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.fetch(xs)
            // This method is not yet functional in CommandInterpreter yet
            // Please live it commented for later uses
            /*
            case "--export" :: filename :: _ =>
                // give the filename of where to export to the interpreter so that it can export at the correct location
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.export(filename)
            */
            case _ =>
                println("Command not found.")
                // in other cases, ask the interpreter to show help
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.showHelp()
    }


    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        // loop on the arguments to handle everything
        for {
            argumentFromTheArray <- args
        } do {
            handleArguments(argumentFromTheArray)
        }

    }
}
```

Your friend uses `print` to debug his code. Is this a good idea and, regardless of whether it is bad or not,
is there a better way to do it? Explain why or why not in max 2 sentences. [3 points]

Your friend claims that the names are good because they describe exactly what is going on. Do you agree? Explain in max
2 sentences. [4 points]
> ???

In order to make the code easier to understand, your friend added comments. Are they correctly used? Explain in max 2
sentences. [4 points]
> ???

Your friend insists that the commented-out case not be touched for now, because the class `CommandInterpreter` will soon
be updated. Think of what your friend is trying to accomplish, and suggest an alternate way to achieve the same
objective in max 2 sentences. [4 points]
